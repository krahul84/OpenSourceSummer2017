OpenSource Project developed for Summer 2017
As a part of Open Source Project, we are developing an Android Application. The description of the project is as follows:

ZipBike

An android app named "ZipBike", which will, basically, provide all the information concerning the Biketown and its bikes to all the users at the click of a button.  

The Biketown API has been used for designing this app.

Biketown is a bike sharing system in Oregon, which has around 100 hubs (bike stations) with over 1000 bikes across Portland, which are primarily used in the downtown area. Its popularity is growing day by day, with more and more users coming forward to use it as it provides them a quick and easy way to commute in and around Portland. Commuters can take a bike from any particular hub and return it to the same or any other hub. These hubs offer hourly, daily and monthly passes.

This app provides its users the 4 nearest bike stations based on their current location. Users can then find the desirable route with the help of Google Maps. Information about the pricing plans offered by Biketown is also provided. The user can then ride the bike using the link to the website provided by our app. The user can also get the number of available bikes at a bike station by searching the station name in our list of bike stations.

Technologies to be used:
1. Android Studio 2.3
2. Min SDK: 21
3. Min OS: Android 5.0 Lollipop
